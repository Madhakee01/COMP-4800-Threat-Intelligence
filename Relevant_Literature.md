My thought process and motivation to this research project on Threat Intelligence Framwwork: Mapping CVEs to MITRE Attack for Automotive Security.

1. Why Automotive Cybersecurity: the need, the current challenges and issues 
2. Why Threat Intelligence: how will it useful for Automotive Industry
3. Mapping CVEs to MITRE ATTA&K for better cybersecurity monitoring and efficient vulnerability management.
        - There is existing research in this area, and Cybersecurity teams are not leveraging this approach. 
5. If time, maybe a ML based protype for the mapping of CVEs to common methods and techniques using MITRE and CVEs related to Automotive Industry.
         - This software prototype will help cybersercurity monitoring/vulnerability management teams
