 Title: 
 
     Notes:
        - In this paper, the author show that existing taxonomies for automotive development process is not enough and does not consider the security aspect. 
        - One important part we need is the derivation of security requirements which usually result from a threat modelling carried out before. In threat modelling, a vehicle's attack surface is analyzed for attack possibilities. 
        - The Automotive information sharing and analysis center (AUTO-ISAC) is an association of different vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. And they exchange information on vulnerabilities is collected and exchanged.
          ○ However this information is only accessed to specific members and not public. 
        - The problem: existing security taxonomies are not suitable for automotive dev and cannot provide more insights on security incidents. The authors provide a solution to classify scheme to automotive security attacks as a uniform taxonomy. 
        - They classify 162 existing attacks and provide a new taxonomy. They focus on security incidents taxonomies in which vulnerability, attack and flaw classification can be distinguished. They propose a tailored taxonomy using Threat Analysis, and Risk Assessment (TARA) and security approach.
        - Their final work presents a taxonomy to describe automotive security attacks, the classification of attacks using different frameworks that provides a uniform description for security developers. 
        - They classified 162 published security incidents as well split 413 staged attacks on vehicles.
