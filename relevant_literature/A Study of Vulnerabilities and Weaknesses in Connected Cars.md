Title: A Study of Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses in Connected Cars

	Notes:
		 -  Security Vulnerabilities in connected cars have various vulnerabilities and devastating consequences. 
		- So the authors in this paper use empirical data to understand the needs of security in the automobile industry. With the help of NVD CVE, CVSS database, the authors map 183 reports from Qualcomm and 28 from the rest of the industry on Automobile industry to develop a better taxanomy. 
		- They found that vulnerabilities generally had high exploitable rate and also had an high impact according to CVSS standards for Automotive related vulnerabilities. 
		- They found that most common weaknesses among the major car companies were protection mechanism failure, information exposure, improper restriction of operations withing the bounds of memory buffer and improper input validation. 
		- They suggest that 47% vulnerabilities were in the infotainment system and 39% were in the telematics control unit. 
		- The connected car has humble beginnings, the first connected car was launched in 1996 with an emergency call system and the industry grown ever since. 
		- Numerous automobile attacks have been demonstrated in previous research where the new connectiveness have proven to have a lot of weaknesses where even life threating accidents can be caused remotely. 
		- To be able to make meaningful progress in the automobile security industry we must collect key data and gain an overview of what the problems are. 
		- From their study, the vulnerabilities showed a high alarming trend of high exploitability rate. The automobility industry ignorance to security is reflected in the exploitability metrics.
			â—‹ My Insights: Even though vulnerabilities had low attack complexity, researchers still proved that it can be hacked with no pre-conditions and could be executed with an average laptop. 
	Vulnerabilities in such software will naturally be easier to find due to the collective feedback and collaborative development. Employing an collaborative strategy could highly support the connected car industry in the future.
