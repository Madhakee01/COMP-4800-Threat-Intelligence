Why we need Threat Intelligence?

Book: The Threat Intelligence Handbook: Moving Toward a Security Intelligence Program

The authors thoughts…

	- The threat intelligence must provide the context to make informed decisions and take action
	- Machines can process and categorize raw data orders exponentially faster than humans. On the other hand, humans can perform intuitive, big-picture analysis much better than any artificial intelligence - as long as they're not overwhelmed with sorting through huge data sets and doing tedious research. When people and machines are paired, each works smarter, saving time and money, reducing human burnout and improving security overall. 

Introduction
	- Cyber threats come from all places of all sorts including third parties, brand attacks and internal threats - and digital business risk is at an all time high. We need a comprehensive strategy that requires the implementation of techniques and technology to proactively reduce risk and stop threats fast. 


Section1

*** this chapter is important because we need to understand why threat intelligence is important. 

Chapter 1: What is Threat Intelligence

	-Today's the cybersecurity industry faces various challenges because of increasingly persistent and devious threat actors; a daily flood of data full of extraneous information and false alarms across multiple systems. 
	- The world of Cybersecurity is in short of skilled professionals. 
		○ 44% of security alerts go uninvestigated 
		○ 66% of companies are breached at least once, 
	- Threat intelligence is knowledge that allows you to prevent and mitigate attacks on digital systems. With data, the threat intelligence provides context like who's attacking you, what their motivation and capabilities are, and what indicators of compromise (IOC'S) in your systems to look for. It helps you make informed decisions about your security. 
	- Vulnerability management teams can benefit from Threat Intelligence.  They have the need to accurately prioritize the most important vulnerabilities. Threat Intelligence provides access to external insights and context that helps them to differentiate immediate threats to their specific enterprise from merely potential threats. 
	- Threat Intelligence lightens the burden by helping the analysts to decide what to prioritize and what to ignore. The intelligence helps analyze data and information to uncover patterns and stories that inform decision-making. 
	- Intelligence is the product of a cycle of identifying the questions, goals, collecting relevant data, processing them, analyzing them, and producing actionable intelligence and distributing them. 
		○ My insights: watch Agent based decision making in Threat Intelligence play a huge role in Cybersecurity in the next decade. 
	- There are two types of threat intelligence: operational and strategic. My research for 4800 focuses on Strategic Threat Intelligence. 
		○ Strategic Threat Intelligence requires a lot of human expertise because it takes time and thought to evaluate and test new adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures against existing security controls. 
			§ My insights: but it can be automated. Mapping CVE to MIITRE ATTA&K is acc a thing. 
		○ Data feeds play a important role in threat intel, they provide valuable raw material for threat intelligence.

Section 2: Applications of Threat Intelligence 

Chapter 5: Threat Intelligence for Vulnerability Management 

      -The key success in VM is to shift the thinking of your security teams from trying to patch everything to make risk-based decisions. They can make good risk-based decisions by taking advantage od more sources like threat intelligence. 
		○ Based on the research from Gartner Inc., there are about 8000 vulnerabilities a year are disclosed. More software's, more vulnerabilities. But less new vulnerabilities, there are cases of old vulnerabilities appearing in new software is something to be concerned about (bad security coding)
		○ One of the greatest values for threat intelligence solution is that it identifies the specific vulnerabilities that represent risk to your organization and gives you visibility into their likelihood of exploitation. 
		○ Relying solely on vulnerability severity is dangerous, so we need to take in account of the threat actors that are actually exploiting vulnerabilities in the industry now. USE CVE, and MITRE
		○ My Insights: use figure 5.3 on pg 49 in my paper and presentation. 
		○ One powerful way to asses the risk of a vulnerability is to look at how far it has progressed from initial identification to availability, weaponizations, commoditization in exploit kits.
			§ My insight: why we need MITRE attack mapping to CVEs.

Section 3: Your Threat Intelligence Program

Chapter 11: Analytical Frameworks for Threat Intelligence. 

	- Threat intelligence frameworks provide structure for thinking about attacks and adversaries. They promote a broad understanding of how attackers think, the methods they use, and where in a attack lifecycle specific events occur.
	- \We need to leverage existing framework like MITRE ATTACK because they develop and maintain CVEs. 
	- The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework was creates to track adversarial behavior over time. It has 11 different tactic categories. The classification of a CVE into its tactics and methods allows security teams to be very granular in describing and track hacking process. It can also be shared between other teams. 
		○ My Insights: It is a tedious process, but Machine Learning can help. '
